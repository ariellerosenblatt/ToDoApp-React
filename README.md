Additions: API


ToDo app where users can add todos, check off todos as completed, and delete todos. I used an API to list, save, modify, and delete your todos via AJAX in Javascript. 


-Adding a new ToDo can be done both by pressing enter and when clicking a button. This is best accomplished by executing your code when the form is submitted, instead of when the user presses a button.
-After adding a ToDo, the input area for new ToDos should become blank
-New ToDos added to list
-Checking off a ToDo should cause it to stay on the list but be styled differently (maybe strikethrough, or faded, etc)
-Deleting a ToDo should remove it from the list entirely

-When page loads, existing ToDos are loaded from the server
-When new ToDo is added, send it to the server
-When a ToDo is "checked off" or deleted, send that to the server
